          <p>This paper presents a fully digital implementation of a memristor hardware (HW) simulator, as the core of an emulator,
          based on a behavioral model of voltage-controlled threshold-type bipolar memristors. Compared to other analog solutions,
          the proposed digital design is compact, easily reconfigurable, demonstrates very good matching with the mathematical model
          on which it is based, and complies with all the required features for memristor emulators. We validated its functionality
          using Altera Quartus II and ModelSim tools targeting low-cost yet powerful field-programmable gate array families. We
          tested its suitability for complex memristive circuits as well as its synapse functioning in artificial neural networks,
          implementing examples of associative memory and unsupervised learning of spatiotemporal correlations in parallel input
          streams using a simplified spike-timing-dependent plasticity. We provide the full circuit schematics of all our digital
          circuit designs and comment on the required HW resources and their scaling trends, thus presenting a design framework for
          applications based on our HW simulator.</p>

          <p>Cellular Automata (CA) have been introduced many decades ago as one of the most efficient parallel computational models able to simulate
            various physical processes and systems where the interactions are local. In this paper, we are trying to advance the application of CA in
            modeling wildfires by accounting for the fuzziness intrinsic to the numerous environmental variables and mechanisms engaged with the
            emergence of the phenomenon itself. The proposed Fuzzy CA (FCA) model adopts a data-driven approach, based on evolutionary optimization,
            which allows incorporating knowledge from real wildfires in order to enhance its accuracy. The main difficulty for doing so arrives from
            the computational complexity of the proposed framework and the burden of computational resources needed for its application, which would
            prevent the real-time prediction of fire spread scenarios. In order to tackle the aforementioned difficulties, we propose model's fully
            parallel implementations in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) hardware. In the article, we first
            investigate the speedup achieved by the developed parallel implementations. Then, we present and discuss two applications to heterogeneous
            landscapes through comparisons with observed wildfires. Moreover, we compare the proposed framework with two different modelling approaches
            and results found are really promising.</p>

          <p>Cellular Automata (CA) is a nature-inspired and widespread computational model which is based on the collective and emergent parallel
            computing capability of units (cells) locally interconnected in an abstract brain-like structure. Each such unit, referred as CA cell,
            performs simplistic computations/processes. However, a network of such identical cells can exhibit nonlinear behavior and be used to model
            highly complex physical phenomena and processes and to solve problems that are highly complicated for conventional computers. Brain activity
            has always been considered one of the most complex physical processes and its modeling is of utter importance. This work combines the CA parallel
            computing capability with the nonlinear dynamics of the memristor, aiming to model brain activity during the epileptic seizures caused by the
            spreading of pathological dynamics from focal to healthy brain regions. A CA-based confrontation extended to include long-range interactions,
            combined with the recent notion of memristive electronics, is thus proposed as a modern and promising parallel approach to modeling of such
            complex physical phenomena. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed design and the appropriate reproduction of the spreading of an
            epileptic seizure.</p>

          <p>Unconventional computing has been studied intensively, even after the appearance of CMOS technology. Currently, it has returned to the
            spotlight because CMOS is about to reach its physical limits, given that the constant demand for more computational power requires for novel
            unconventional computing solutions. In this area, the oscillatory internal motion mechanism of slime mould, namely Physarum Polycephalum,
            could serve as an alternative concept for the design and development of electronic circuits that exploit the memristive dynamics and simple
            LC contours to deliver solutions for computationally hard to be solved problems. In this direction, this work presents how bio-inspired
            memristive LC oscillators with a coupling capacitor can be synchronized to perform the functionalities of a biological neuron, also able to
            execute more complex computations, aiming to model biological neural systems much more advanced than the neuron-less slime mould biological
            organism. This work proposes a connection between the function mechanism of a simple biological organism and that of complex biological systems,

          <p>Memristors promise to revolutionise the world of electronics in the years to come. Besides their most popular applications in the
            fields of non-volatile memory design and neuro-morphic system development, their ability to process signals and store data in the same
            physical location may allow the conception of novel mem-computing machines outperforming state-of-the-art hardware systems suffering from
            the Von Neumann bottleneck. The complexity of real-world memristor models, capturing the inherent nonlinearity of the switching kinetics
            of the nanodevices, is one of the obstacles towards an extensive exploration of the full potential of memristors in nanoelectronics. It is
            well-known, in fact, that serious convergence issues frequently arise in the numerical simulation of the differential algebraic equation
            sets modelling the dynamics of real-world memristors. In this work we propose a strategy to develop a general closed-form mathematical
            representation of a real-world voltage-controlled memristor manufactured by Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The study aims to derive an
            analytical formula for the memductance of the nano-device under a general voltage input, starting off from the DC case. This research
            should be of great benefit to circuit designers, which typically use analytical formulas for the first hands-on calculations in the search

          <p>Cellular Automata (CAs) is a well-known parallel, bio-inspired, computational model. It is based on the capability of simpler, locally
            interacting units, i.e. the CAs cells, to evolve in time, giving rise to emergent computation, suitable to model physical system behavior,
            prediction of natural phenomena and multi-dimensional problem solutions. Moreover, at the same time CAs constitute a promising computing
            platform, beyond the von Neumann architecture. In this paper, a memristor device is considered to be the basic module of a CA cell circuit
            implementation, performing as a combined memory and processing element to implement CA-based circuits, able to model sufficiently systems
            and applications as mentioned above, targeting tentatively to a more energy efficient design compared to the conventional electronics. In

          <p>Given the complexity of the mathematical descriptions of real nanodevices with memristor fingerprints, convergence issues often emerge
            in the simulation of circuits employing memristors, even for a limited number of instances. Actually the simulation of one-memristor
            circuits may also be troublesome for some inputs and/or initial conditions. This problem prevents a thorough test of memristor circuit

          <p>FPGAs are reconfigurable electronic platforms, well-suited to implement complex artificial neural networks (ANNs). To this end, the compact
            hardware (HW) implementation of artificial synapses is an important step to obtain human brain-like functionalities at circuit-level. In this
            context, the memristor has been proposed as the electronic analogue of biological synapses, but the price of commercially available samples
            still remains high, hence motivating the development of HW emulators. In this work we present the first digital memristor emulator based upon
            a voltage-controlled threshold-type bipolar memristor model. We validate its functionality in low-cost yet powerful FPGA families. We test
            its suitability for complex memristive circuits and prove its synaptic properties in a small associative memory via a perceptron ANN.</p>

          <p>Within an ever-increasing variety of applications for memristors, adaptive electronic circuits have attracted considerable attention lately.
            This paper extends previously published work on memristive filter design to include the potential of composite memristive devices as damping
            elements in LC-based sensing circuits. The collective response of several LC contours with different memristive damping is considered. A
            thorough study of the circuit properties is performed in an attempt to exploit the high sensitivity of the circuit, other than address it as
            a typical drawback. The simulated circuits could find application in bio-inspired information processing, whereas could lead to better
            behavioral models for biological organisms.</p>

          <p>This paper presents a Fuzzy Cellular Automata (FCA) model with the aim to cope with the computational complexity and data uncertainties
            that characterize the simulation of wildfire spreading on real landscapes. Moreover, parallel implementations of the proposed FCA model, on
            both GPU and FPGA, are discussed and investigated. According to the results, the parallel models exhibit significant speedups over the
            corresponding sequential algorithm. As a possible application, the proposed model could be embedded on a portable electronic system for
            real-time prediction of fire spread scenarios.</p>
